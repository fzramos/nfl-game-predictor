# NFL Game Predictions
- The purpose of this project is to predict the outcome of upcoming NFL games based on the existing statistics of the participating teams.
- To fullfill the the goal, we need to:
    1. Build a training dataset of NFL game statistics. This dataset should include basic NFL statistics like score, weather, offensive yards, and turnovers as well as advance statistics such as of QB Rating.
    2. Use machine learning to build a statisical model based on the training dataset that predicts a given match-up's winner. 
    3. Deploy the model to predict the outcome of upcoming NFL games. This step includes automating the process of gathering the required NFL statistics for the model input.
